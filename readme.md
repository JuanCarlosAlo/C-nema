## Description

Bites is a food delivery app that can track the time of your orders and have a rating sistem for every item.

## What have I learned in this project?

In this project, I learned how to use timers based on the date of the expected delivery calculated by the time that takes from point A (Sol, Madrid) to point B (coordinates given by the user) given by an API (Open Route). The time given is added to the time of the delivery made and it's saved in the database in MongoDB, with that information, the timer and a completion bar are created. Also after purchase, the user can rate the items purchased, which determinates the recommended items from the recommended tab.
